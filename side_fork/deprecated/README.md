# Forward_ADMIX

## Updates:

02/10/2018 - Jerome Kelleher shared the correct way to pick random samples from TreeSeq files. It runs the ancestry loop very fast, but gives me funny graphs at the end (maybe the loop have to be corrected first, somehow?)


## Index of files
File name| description
------------ | -------------
recipe_16.5.slim| File copied exactly as in the SLiM guide for studying admixture of two populations. You can call it on command line with ```$ slim -seed 1234567 recipe_16.5.slim > outfile```
 simulated_msprime.py| simple file to use msprime to simulate *TreeSequence* and use the ```simplify()``` function from msprime
 print_tree_tables.py|script to simply print the output tables from the ".trees" files generated by SLiM
 print_simplify_tables| script to output the ".trees" tables after using the ```simplify()``` function
 ancestry_proportions.py|script with the loop to obtain ancestry proportions along the genome
