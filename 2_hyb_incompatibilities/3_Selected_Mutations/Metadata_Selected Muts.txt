#Meta data for scripts - HYBRID INCOMPATIBILITIES + ANCESTRY

###############################
# ANALYSIS SELECTED MUTATIONS #
###############################

These scripts are for analysis of the genome windows and selected mutations
At the top of the scripts there are "common" variables
(divergence time, working directory, which type of outcome is being analysed)


#Alleles and Ancestry
- 1a_fate_alleles.R
  * This classifyies mutations into "fixed" and "polymorphic" states
  * This is done based on the initial admixture proportions.

- 1b_ancestry.R
  * This is for binning the ancestry into the right window size

#Replicates outcome & graphing allele frequencies
- 2a_replicates_outcome.r
  * Gets which replicates lost/kept the minor ancestry

-2b_graph_fate_alleles.r
  * allele frequency graphs

#Separating Derived Alleles
- 3_classify_mutations.r
  * Gets only the derived mutations to do the Delta calculations

#Delta calculations
- 4_get_delta_final.r
  *Calculates the delta within 1cM windows

#Binning delta`
- 5_intervals_delta.r
  * summary stats for Delta
  * dividing it into 5 categories

#Graphing delta
- 6_graph_delta.r
  * Graphing delta by recombination replicates

#Summary Delta
- 7_summary_delta.R

#Comparing plots
- 8_compare_plots.r
  * comparison between runs with different outcomes
