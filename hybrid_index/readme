#run bash script "run_slim.sh"
#remember to change the name of the runs, 
#to create new folders... 
#(and not overwrite what you already did)
$: bash ./run_slim.sh

#the parameters for SLiM are inside the bash script (pop sizes, name of the outputfile)
#remember to change the generation numbers on the python script of ancestry
#(at wich generations you have "sampled" and created a separate .trees file)
#the generation number of the samples are within the slim script
#ancestry_auto.py - is the script to get the ancestry proportions
#launch_slim python is only to parse the command line arguments into the slim script,
# this ^ does not need anymore changes, unless you want to add any other arguments/constants
